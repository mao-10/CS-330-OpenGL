# CS-330-OpenGL
How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  I approach designing software by considering how to make it reusable and secure. For this project my design process was to focus on different aspects seperately. I first designed and replicated the 3D objects, then focused on camera movement and controls, textures, and lighting. This project has helped me learn about OpenGL and the design process. In the future, when making projects I can approach it similarily by breaking down functionalities. 

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  I created functions that could be reusable. Instead of rewriting the same lines of code, these functions made my code more clean, reusable, and readable. Knowledge of computation graphics and visualizations can help me in the future in understanding 3D scenes and games. It also helps me understand interactivity and how input methods can change.
